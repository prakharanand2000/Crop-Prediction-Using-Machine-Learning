# Crop-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Farming relies upon the different soil properties. A good yield of crops is a troublesome assignment since it includes different variables like soil type, temperature, humidity and so on. Be that as it may, in the present time, food production and expectations of yield is getting hampered because of unnatural climatic changes, which will unfavourably influence the economy of the people involved in the farming business, especially the farmers, by getting a destitute yield and furthermore causing the farmers to stay less recognizable in determining the future harvests. In the event that it is feasible to track down the yield prior to planting it, it would be of incredible assistance to the farmers and the others to decide and take decisions which are beneficial for their business. The proposed project would take care of agricultural issues by considering the farming region based on soil properties and suggesting the most fitting crops to grow to the farmers, subsequently assisting them with fundamentally increasing the yield and diminishing the chance of a misfortune. Our proposal is a framework which utilizes diverse machine learning methods like unsupervised learning, K-Means clustering, Predictive Modelling, Logistic Regression, and so on with the end goal being that it suggests the most reasonable crop to grow according to the given soil conditions.
